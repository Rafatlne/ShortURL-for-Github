  "body": "# ShortUrl-Auto-Redirector-for-Github\r\nA simple JS script to make short URL like link redirection possible on websites hosted on github. \r\n\r\nWhen sharing links to friends or something a personal shorturl is easier to remember as well.  \r\nUsing the github custom 404 page with some javascript, this script can redirect any keyword to any url.\r\n\r\nEx: \r\n\r\n    http://example.github.io/woof  => https://www.reddit.com/r/woof_irl/top/?sort=top&t=all\r\n\r\nLive example:\r\n[sohanchy.com/woof](http://sohanchy.com/woof) \r\nredirects to =>  \r\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/woof_irl/top/?sort=top&t=all](https://www.reddit.com/r/woof_irl/top/?sort=top&t=all)\r\n\r\n###How to use:\r\n - Download **404.html** file and **redirectorDB.js** or *clone this repo*.\r\n - **Replace** references to **sohanchy.com** in **404.html** with your **default fallback site**. The script will redirect to this site when short url is not found. You can the actual 404 page here as well.\r\n - Modify **redirectorDB.js** to your needs. Examples are given, just follow basic JS object syntax.\r\n - Upload to the master branch for a User/Organization Pages site, or to the gh-pages branch for a Project Pages site.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Drawbacks\r\n - Just one minor drawback, you can not  use the default github 404 page,\r\n   you have to either have a fallback website or use a custom 404 page.\r\n\r\nCreated by: [Sohan Chowdhury](http://sohanchy.com)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
